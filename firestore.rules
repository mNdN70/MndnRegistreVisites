/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Visit Logging Application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on a combination of public read access where appropriate and strict ownership for write operations.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of two top-level collections: `persons_to_visit` and `visits`. The `persons_to_visit` collection is publicly readable but not writable from the client, while the `visits` collection is publicly readable but only allows authorized creation, updating and deletion.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: Read access to both collections is generally open to facilitate easy data retrieval for application users.
 * - Owner-Only Writes: Create, update, and delete operations on the `visits` collection are restricted to authorized users based on an ownership field (`creatorId`).
 * - Denormalized "active" Field: The `active` field on the `Visit` entity is used to efficiently query for current visits and does not impact security rules.
